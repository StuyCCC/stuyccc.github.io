Lesson 1: What even is Python

First, I want everyone to log in to the desktop in front of you.
Open up IDLE. If you don't know how to, a teacher will come around to help you.
!!h3!!You will need to get Python 3 on your home system if you want to do things at home. If you need any help, please don't hesitate to contact me, a VP, or a teacher!

We have logic in Python
We do logic using booleans, which just mean variables that are True or False

We also have logical comparators
!!ulist!!
or
and
!!endulist!!

<table style="border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;">
            <tr>
                <th>boolean p</th>
                <th>boolean q</th>
                <th>not p</th>
                <th>not q</th>
                <th>p and q</th>
                <th>p or q</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>T</td>
                <td>T</td>
                <td>F</td>
                <td>F</td>
                <td>T</td>
                <td>T</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>T</td>
                <td>F</td>
                <td>F</td>
                <td>T</td>
                <td>F</td>
                <td>T</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>F</td>
                <td>T</td>
                <td>T</td>
                <td>F</td>
                <td>F</td>
                <td>T</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>F</td>
                <td>F</td>
                <td>T</td>
                <td>T</td>
                <td>F</td>
                <td>F</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

What are:
!!olist!!
(a and b) or a
(a and b) and b
(a or (a and a)) or a
(b and b) or a
(b and b) and b
And maybe some more if there are too easy
!!endolist!!

Where will this be useful???
Logic statements!

Nani? What are logic statements?

They're really useful blocks of code in CS that make the computer decide whether or not to do a thing
How to?

A simple if statement goes like this
if (<boolean expression>):
	<do this>

What if you want the computer to do something else if <boolean expression> isn't true
And if-else statment does this!
if (<boolean expression>):
	<do this>
else:
	<do this instead>

And if you have multiple conditions:
if (<boolean expression>):
	<do this>
elif (<another boolean expression>):
	<do this instead>
else:
	<do this if none of the <boolean expression>s are true>

!!h3!!I know this lesson has a lot of stuff but most of it is fairly simple so bear with me

Now on to math!!!
We can do math in Python kind of similarly to how we do it irl
!!ulist!!
5 + 5 = 10
4 - 7 = -3
5 * 4 = 20
6 / 4 = ?????
!!endulist!!

What are the question marks there for? Well, CS can be weird
In Python 2, 6/4 returns 1. In Python 3, 6/4 returns 1.5

Questions?

So when you're dividing, be sure to take this into account. When you always want an answer with a decimal point, use the function float(<num>)

Anyway, we can also do math with floating point numbers (this means it has a decimal point)
We can also convert between floats and integers
!!ulist!!
float(5) = 5.0
int(5.5) = 5
int(5.4) = 5
!!endulist!!

Finally, we can also define variables (just like in math)
If I wanted "a" to be 5, I would write
	a = 5

Knowing that, do these problems

Given a = 5, b = 6
!!olist!!
a + b
a - b
a * b
a / b
b / a
a / 6.0
!!endolist!!

One last thing about variables: we can change their values
	a = 5 #now a is 5
	a = 6 #now a is 6
	a = a + 1 #now a is 7
	a += 1 #now a is 8

What's this += thing? When you want to change a variable relative to itself, we use special operators
Given a and x are numbers
!!ulist!!
a = a + x <---> a += x
a = a - x <---> a -= x
a = a * x <---> a *= x
a = a / x <---> a /= x
!!endulist!!

!!h2!!I will now take questions and stuff

And that's all folks. Thanks for coming and come back next time to learn about Strings!!!

!!h3!!Note that this (and every) lesson will be updated with code snippets and further details (hopefully) on the night of the meeting
