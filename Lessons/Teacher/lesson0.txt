Lesson 0: What even is this club?
First, the leadership shall introduce themselves.

Now you guys shall introduce yourselves.

This is the first joint lesson, and the last one for a while. From now on, I shall tell the teachers which lesson we're on and it's up to y'all to go to the website, find it, and learn! I trust you teachers don't need as much guidance as the younglings here

!!h3!!And now we have to talk business!

In this club you will learn:
!!ulist!!
How to write Python
How to CS
How to think in CS
How to apply CS knowledge to Competitive Programming
!!endulist!!

Initially, we shall be spending some time sans computers because it's better to understand concepts then apply them to writing code than to just jump in with code

Learning Python may be easier than learning C or something, but it still takes some time and commitment and, potentially, work outside of class. So if you hate learning, adios!

!!h4!!I'll take any questions or comments y'all have now
