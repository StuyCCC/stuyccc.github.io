<html><h1>Lesson 0: What even is this club?</h1>
<p>First, the leadership shall introduce themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>Now you guys shall introduce yourselves.</p>
<br>
<p>This is the first joint lesson, and the last one for a while. From now on, I shall tell the teachers which lesson we're on and it's up to y'all to go to the website, find it, and learn! I trust you teachers don't need as much guidance as the younglings here</p>
<br>

<h3>And now we have to talk business!</h3>

<p>Emails (and the importance of replying to them!)</p>

<br>
<p>In this club you will learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>How to write Python</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to CS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to think in CS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to apply CS knowledge to Competitive Programming</p>
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>Initially, we shall be spending some time sans computers because it's better to understand concepts then apply them to writing code than to just jump in with code</p>
<br>
<p>Learning Python may be easier than learning C or something, but it still takes some time and commitment and, potentially, work outside of class. So if you hate learning, adios!</p>
<br>

<h4>I'll take any questions or comments y'all have now</h4>
