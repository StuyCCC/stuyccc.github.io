            <h3>For Loops</h3>
            <p>In general, a <i>loop</i> is a segment of code that runs repeatedly until a condition is met. We will first examine <i>for loops</i>. It is split into three main parts split by semicolons:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
for ([INITIALIZATION]; [CONDITION]; [OPERATION]) {
	// code that is run repeatedly
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>We examine these parts one by one. The [INIT] is executed only once before the loop starts. Usually, we declare some counter variable that we let run through some range of numbers. For instance, it can be <b><i>int i = 0</i></b>, where i is short for index. Note that i can only be used within the body of the for loop.</p>
            <p>The loop is then repeated until [CONDITION] is false, where [CONDITION] is some boolean expression. Since the counter variable we declared in [INIT] will be changed, it often involves that counter variable. For example, this condition can be <b><i>i &lt; 50</i></b>. So long as i is less than 50, the loop will keep running.</p>
            <p>The [OPERATION] part is executed after each run-through of the code within the loop. Since we’re using the counter i to keep track of iterations or something else, we usually make some changes to i as the loop progresses, like increasing it by 1, shown as follows: <i><b>i = i + 1</b></i>.</p>

            <h3>Syntactic Sugar</h3>
            <p>To make our lives a bit easier, we can shorten the operation described above. Typing i += 1 and i = i + 1  serve the exact same function: increasing i by 1. This works for any operation (-, *, /, %) and any number or variable on the right. For instance, if a = 7, then running a %= 5 will turn it into 2.</p>
            <p>If we’re increasing or decreasing by 1 in particular, we can do even better. a++ is the exact same as a += 1, and a-- is the same as a -= 1. This is the most commonly used notation when changing counter variables in for loops.</p>
            <p>Now, let’s say we wanted to find the sum of all integers from 1 to 50. We can do it as follows:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 50; i++) {
	sum += i;
}
cout &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; ‘\n’;
            </code></pre>
            <p>We first initialize a counter variable called i, which starts from 1. Then, for each pass of the loop, we add the value of i to a variable sum. Finally, we increment i by 1. This runs until i exceeds 50, in which case the loop stops.</p>
            <p>This shorthand can be used for most other binary operations (ie. operations between two variables), such as:</p>
			<pre><code class="language-cpp">
int x = 1;
x *= 3; // x = x * 3, x is now 3
x -= 2; // x = x - 2, x is now 1
x++; // x = x + 1, x is now 2
x /= 2; // x = x / 2, x is now 1
x += 17; // x = x + 17, x is now 18
x %= 5; // x = x % 5, x is now 3
x--; // x = x - 1, x is now 2
x += x; // x = x + x, x is now 4
cout &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; ‘\n’;
			</code></pre>
			<p><b>The <i>break</i> and <i>continue</i> keywords</b></p>
            <p>The keywords <i>break</i> and <i>continue</i> have an effect on the flow of a loop. When <i>break</i> is run, the loop exits entirely, and whatever code comes after the loop starts running. When <i>continue</i> is run, it skips the remainder of the looped code to the [OPERATION] portion, after which the <i>next iteration</i> of the loop is run.</p>
            <p>Putting <i>break</i> and <i>continue</i> directly within the loop is a bit pointless. They’re usually put within if-statements so the skipping of iterations or exiting the loop is controlled by some condition.</p>
			<pre><code class="language-cpp">
// Example code that prints all odd numbers from 1 to 71 (inclusive) except for 7
for(int i = 1; i &lt;=99; i += 2){
	if(i == 7){ // if i is 7, don't do the rest of the loop, ie don't print it and jump to i = 9 case
		continue;
	}
	cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; `\n`;
	if(i == 71){ // if i is 71, exit the loop entirely
		break;
	}
}
			</code></pre>
            <h3>While Loops</h3>
            <p>While loops are a bit simpler than for loops. It is formulated as such:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
while ([CONDITION]) {
	// code that is run repeatedly
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>As it suggests, the code inside the body of the while loop runs <i>while</i> the condition is true. It checks the condition each time before the body is run. Note that break and continue work here too, but it’s a bit easier to mess up and have it run forever.</p>
            <p>While loops and for loops are completely analogous, meaning anything you can do with one loop you can do with another. The only real difference between the two is that in the while loop the [INITIALIZATION] and [OPERATION] are not defined outside the structure, while in the for loop they are defined inside of the structure. This causes a difference in <i>scope</i>.</p>

            <h3>Scope</h3>
            <p>Defining something in a structure means that thing can only be used in the structure. For example, if I had the following for loop:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    // do something
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>The variable i would only be able to be used inside the for loop and not in anything after it. However, this is different if we declared a while loop like the following:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
int i = 0;
while (i &lt; 10) {
    // code that is run repeatedly
    i++;
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>In this case i is declared outside of the while loop so it can be used even after the while loop has finished</p>
            <p>Once you understand this difference in scope, you can basically use for and while loops interchangeably.</p>
