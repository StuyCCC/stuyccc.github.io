            <h3>What is a programming language?</h3>
            <p>A programming language is a way for humans to communicate with computers. A computer cannot understand English (or any other human languages), but it can understand machine languages. Some common programming languages include Python, Java, C/C++.</p>

            <h3>Why C++?</h3>
            <p>C++ is uber fast, relatively flexible, and has a large standard library. Even if that doesn't make sense, just know that C++ is the most popular coding language used in competitive programming for very good reasons. So if we are going to teach you guys a coding language, why not teach the best of the best. </p>

            <h3>Replit setup</h3>
            <p>To run C++ code, you need a code editor to write the code and a compiler to run the code. A website called Replit combines an editor and compiler. It's really use for beginners to use.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to <a href="http://replit.com">Replit</a> and create an account</li>
                <li>Go to <a href="https://replit.com/@ybenp/CCC-Beginner-Lesson-1">this link</a> to access your first repository</li>
                <li>Click Fork Repl to start coding</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Hello World</h3>
            <p>The code for your first file, which is typically Hello World (copy and paste this into your editor and save it):</p>
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!\n";
}
			</code></pre>
            <p>The first line "includes" a large file with prewritten functions. Programmers are lazy! They don't want to rewrite commonly used functions over and over again. The bits/stdc++.h file is included in the C++ compiler we suggest you to use.</p>
            <p>This include file has a HUGE number of functions-the names of these functions could easily overlap with those from other libraries. Thus, another level of organization we use is <b>namespaces</b>. The second line identifies that we're using a specific family of functions: in this case, functions from the standard library.</p>
            <p>'int main()' is always the first function that's called when the program is run. It is also the computer's only point of entry-all other functions must be called from main. Thus, this is where we put the contents of our code.</p>
            <p>The one line we have inside the main program is just an instruction to print "Hello World!". We will talk more about printing in the future.</p>
            <p>Note that this line is ended with a ';'. Notice as well that using namespace std is also ended with a ';'. ;'s are used to mark the end of a line in a c++ program, and almost every line you type will be ended with a ';', so better get used to them soon.</p>

            <h3>Running Programs</h3>
            <p>Click "Run" at the top of the page. Complete exercise 1.</p>

            <h3>cout</h3>
            <p>In C++, "cout" tells the computer to start outputting. For words and text in general, enclose them in double quotes "". We will talk about what the double quotes do later. For numbers like 35, there's no need for double quotes. </p>
            <p>Each thing you want to output should be separated by "<<". To start a newline (like the Enter/Return key on your keyboard), use "\n", where n stands for newline. </p>
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!\n";
    cout << 35 << "\n";
}
            </code></pre>

            <h3>Mathematical Expressions</h3>
            <p>Mathematical expressions work the same way as regular math, with one exception in division that we will discuss next lesson.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!\n";
    cout << 3 + 5 << "\n"; // 8
    cout << 3 * 5 << "\n"; // 15
    cout << 6 / 3 << "\n"; // 2
    cout << (3 + 5) * 6 / 2 << "\n"; // 24
}
            </code></pre>     
            
            <h3>Variables</h3>
            <p>In math, you learned about variables in an equation. They represent a number. For example, if x + 3 = 5, then x = 2. But what if we use them in an expression instead? For x + 3, x can be any number we would like, since x doesn't have to satisfy any equations. </p>
            <p>In C++, we can use variables to represent numbers. Let's start with integers (We'll discuss other types in the next lesson). To use variables, we must first let the computer know that we are starting a variable: "int x". Then we can use the equal sign = to assign values to it. </p>
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!\n";
    int x, y;
    x = 3;
    y = 5;
    // Shortcut: we can also write
    // int x = 3, y = 5;
    cout << x + y << "\n"; // 8
    cout << x * y << "\n"; // 15
    cout << 6 / x << "\n"; // 2
    cout << (x + y) * 6 / 2 << "\n"; // 24
}
                </code></pre>  
            
            <h3>cin</h3>
            <p>Finally, we will discuss how to input stuff in C++. Since we want the computer to store (remember) what we type in, we need to initialize (start) variables first. After that, we can use the "cin" command, similar to the "cout" command we learned earlier. However, we use ">>" instead of "<<". </p>
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!\n";
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    // You type "3 5" and press enter on your keyboard
    cout << x + y << "\n"; // 8
    cout << x * y << "\n"; // 15
    cout << 6 / x << "\n"; // 2
    cout << (x + y) * 6 / 2 << "\n"; // 24
}
            </code></pre>
