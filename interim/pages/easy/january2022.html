                <p>The time constraints are very generous. Past that there is only two things to see, it isn't worthwhile to increment b after any divisions have started, and never will b have to be incremented very high. The reason for the first claim is floor(a / (b + 1)) &lt; floor(a / b), so for any pair of additions and divisions, it is better to the addition first as it will improve the subsequent division.</p>
                <p>The reason for the second claim is we can upper bound the amount of moves it takes to make a number 0. Namely increment b once (a moves) and then divide a by the value of b &gt;= 2 (in the worst case taking around log_2(10^9) equal to roughly 30 moves). Therefore the maximum amount of moves to make a zero is 31.</p>
                <p>This means we can iterate over all possible sequence of moves (as all additions are before divisions) and see which gets a to zero the quickest. That means trying first one addition followed by the required amount of divisions. Then two additions followed by some amount of divisions. Then continuing until 31 additions followed by some required amount of divisions is tried. The minimum of some of number of additions and number of divisions is the answer.</p>

                <p>Look at the top row and for each character there, see what the bottom row should be. If the top row has the patter "LR" (we know there will be an 'L' followed by an 'R') we can just mimic it with an "LR" on the bottom row. If there is a 'U' on the top row, that domino has to be completed by outputting a 'D' on the bottom row. Similarly if there is a "RL" pattern then that can be mimiced on the bottom row with another "RL" patter and a 'D' on the top row will be completed with a 'U' on the bottom row.</p>
                <p>Creating a new string using these rules will solve the problem.</p>

                <p>The solution is to look at the parity (odd or evenness) of |a-b|. For it to be possible to use a set of operations to get c and d the difference |c-d| must have the same parity as |a-b| (both odd or both even). This is because adding k to both a and b maintains the value of |a-b| and adding k to one number and subtracting k from the other adds (or subtracts) an even number from |a-b|. |a-b| must equal |c-d| if a=c and b=d so and so the differences must have the same starting parity.</p>
                <p>If the parities are the same we can construct the solution with casework.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>if c = 0, d = 0 then we are done, output zero moves</li>
                    <li>if c = d != 0 then we increment a and b by k = c = d. Output one move</li>
                    <li>if c != d but still works then k = |c-d|/2 and then add k and subtract k to the appropriate a or b.</li>
                    <li>This makes |a-b| correct, but a and b could both still be too low. This can be fixed by adding another k to a and b.</li>
                    <li>Output two moves.</li>
                    <li>if the parity check fails output -1.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A note: checking parity and seeing it is invariant between |a-b| and |c-d| is something to keep in mind. It comes up occasionally. Looking for an invariant is a good general problem solving strategy and checking parities can often be helpful as well.</p>
