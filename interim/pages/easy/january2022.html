                <p>The time constraints are very generous. Past that there is only two things to see, it isn't worthwhile to increment b after any divisions have started, and never will b have to be incremented very high. The reason for the first claim is floor(a / (b + 1)) &lt; floor(a / b), so for any pair of additions and divisions, it is better to the addition first as it will improve the subsequent division.</p>
                <p>The reason for the second claim is we can upper bound the amount of moves it takes to make a number 0. Namely increment b once (a moves) and then divide a by the value of b &gt;= 2 (in the worst case taking around log_2(10^9) equal to roughly 30 moves). Therefore the maximum amount of moves to make a zero is 31.</p>
                <p>This means we can iterate over all possible sequence of moves (as all additions are before divisions) and see which gets a to zero the quickest. That means trying first one addition followed by the required amount of divisions. Then two additions followed by some amount of divisions. Then continuing until 31 additions followed by some required amount of divisions is tried. The minimum of some of number of additions and number of divisions is the answer.</p>

                <p>Look at the top row and for each character there, see what the bottom row should be. If the top row has the patter "LR" (we know there will be an 'L' followed by an 'R') we can just mimic it with an "LR" on the bottom row. If there is a 'U' on the top row, that domino has to be completed by outputting a 'D' on the bottom row. Similarly if there is a "RL" pattern then that can be mimiced on the bottom row with another "RL" patter and a 'D' on the top row will be completed with a 'U' on the bottom row.</p>
                <p>Creating a new string using these rules will solve the problem.</p>

                <p>The solution is to look at the parity (odd or evenness) of |a-b|. For it to be possible to use a set of operations to get c and d the difference |c-d| must have the same parity as |a-b| (both odd or both even). This is because adding k to both a and b maintains the value of |a-b| and adding k to one number and subtracting k from the other adds (or subtracts) an even number from |a-b|. |a-b| must equal |c-d| if a=c and b=d so and so the differences must have the same starting parity.</p>
                <p>If the parities are the same we can construct the solution with casework.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>if c = 0, d = 0 then we are done, output zero moves</li>
                    <li>if c = d != 0 then we increment a and b by k = c = d. Output one move</li>
                    <li>if c != d but still works then k = |c-d|/2 and then add k and subtract k to the appropriate a or b.</li>
                    <li>This makes |a-b| correct, but a and b could both still be too low. This can be fixed by adding another k to a and b.</li>
                    <li>Output two moves.</li>
                    <li>if the parity check fails output -1.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A note: checking parity and seeing it is invariant between |a-b| and |c-d| is something to keep in mind. It comes up occasionally. Looking for an invariant is a good general problem solving strategy and checking parities can often be helpful as well.</p>

                <p>The solution (if it exists can be constructed). Let a_1, a_2,..., a_k be single character strings. We know these compose the first k characters of the string and also must compose the last k characters of the string. Additionally, these first k characters must be the reverse of the last k characters because of the order they are added to the string. If this isn't he case the answer is "NO". Finally, a_k+1 can fill the middle part of the string left. If there is string left to fill (i.e. 2k &lt; n) then the answer is "YES", else "NO".</p>
                <p>Example construction: "abcddcba"<br>k = 2<br>a_1 = "a"<br>a_2 = "b"<br>a_3 = "cddc"<br>so the answer is "YES"</p>
                <p>"abba"<br>k = 2<br>a_1 = "a"<br>a_2 = "b"<br>nothing left for a_3 so the answer is "NO"</p>

                <p>The first thing to notice is that a & b &lt;= min(a, b).</p>
                <p>Consider the following example<br>a = 1001<br>b = 1011<br>a&b=1001</p>
                <p>Only a place value where both a and b are 1 becomes a 1, otherwise the place value is 0. As replacing a 1 with a 0 at a place value decreases the value of that number, a&b &lt;= min(a, b).</p>
                <p>The second (and final thing to notice) is that it is possible to preform the operation on every pair of elements in the sequence. Consider a pair, a_i, a_j (i &lt; j). Preforming the operation on the interval [i, j] results in a_i = a_i & a_j = a_j = a_j & a_i. Note all of the other changed in the interval will be &lt;= to what they were before by the first thing noticed.</p>
                <p>Therefore, the answer can be found by taking all pairs and preforming the operation on them. This causes every element in the array to become a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & ... & a_n, the answer.</p>

                <p>There are a bunch of solutions (the problem author for example just outputs 2,3,4,...,n,n+1 which you can check works yourself). The one I used was printing out prime numbers.</p>
                <p>A prime number doesn't isn't divisible by the number before it becuase there is no integer &gt; 1 which divides it. The hard part of this solution however is to find these prime numbers. Generally though, there are a lot of prime numbers so it is likely that the solution will work. The solution is quick to code and quick to test locally.</p>
                <p>To check if some natural number n is prime, verify that all integers &gt; 1 and &lt;= sqrt(n) don't divide n. This takes O(sqrt(n)) time, iterating over sqrt(n) integers.</p>
                <p>Then, starting at some small prime, say 2 or 3, iterate over the integers, checking if each is prime and outputing it if it is. Finish outputing numbers when n have been printed.</p>
                <p>Quickly timing the program locally with the maximum test cases will show it runs fast enough. Alternatively, if you know a lot of math you might know the prime number theorem which approximates the amount of primes and shows this algorithm will run quickly enough.</p>
