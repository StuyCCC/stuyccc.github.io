            <h3> Time Complexity </h3>
            <p>Time Complexity is describes how long it will take an algorithm to run as the size of the input grows.
            In other time complexity is the <em>rate of growth</em> or <em>order of growth</em> of an algorithm.</p>

            <p>For competitive programming we focus on the worst case running time.
            Given evil inputs which will make our algorithm run as slow as possible what is the runtime's rate of growth?</p>

            <p>We notate the worst case time complexity with big O notation.
            For example if our we say the size of our input (say the length of an input list) is <script type="math/tex">n</script>
            and our algorithm's runtime grows linearly with respect to <script type="math/tex">n</script>
            <em>we say the complexity of the algorithm is <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{O}(n)</script></em>.</p>

            <p>In this example some sample runtimes for different <script type="math/tex">n</script> might be:
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th><script type="math/tex">n</script></th>
                    <th>runtime</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>100ms</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>200ms</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>300ms</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>400ms</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            </p>
            <h4>Big O Notation Rules</h4>
            <p>We can <em>drop constant factors</em> as they don't change the order of growth.
            A cubic will for sufficiently large <script type="math/tex">n</script> grow faster than any quadratic no matter any constant factors on either polynomial.<br><br>
            ex: <script type="math/tex">2n^2 \text{ is }\mathcal{O}(n^2)</script>.</p>

            <p>We can <em>drop all terms in an expression but the fastest growing term</em>. For sufficiently large <script type="math/tex">n</script>,
            <script type="math/tex">n^3 + n^2 + n + 1</script> will grow slower than <script type="math/tex">n^4</script>, for example.<br><br>
            ex: <script type="math/tex">n^2 + n + 1 \text{ is }\mathcal{O}(n^2)</script>.</p>

            <p>To calculate time complexity count operations (sort of). Something like an addition of two ints will always take the same amount of time
            so counting how many additions happen (in terms of <script type="math/tex">n</script>) can give an idea of the time complexity.
            Additions, variable instantiation, increments, array indexing, and many other things <em>generally</em> take the same amount of time no matter what.
            We call these <em>constant time</em> or <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{O}(1)</script> operations. <br><br>
            Making time complexities feel intuitive and getting good at analyzing algorithms is just practice.</p>

            <h3>Maximum Subarray Sum</h3>
            <h4>Question</h4>
            <p>
            Given an array, <code>A</code>, of integers with size <script type="math/tex">n</script> find the contiguous (possibly empty) subarray with maximum sum. <br><br>
            The sum of a subarray is the sum of all the elements in that array. The sum of an empty subarray is <script type="math/tex">0</script>.
            <br><br>
            ex: the maximum subarray sum of <code>[1,2,-4,2,4]</code> is <script type="math/tex">6</script> with the subarray <code>[2,4]</code>.
            ex: the maximum subarray sum of <code>[-1,-1,-1]</code> is <script type="math/tex">0</script> with the empty subarray.
            </p>

            <h4>Simple Solution</h4>
            <p>
            The most straightforward solution is to simply find the subarray sum of every single possible subarray and then take the maximum of all of these.
            To implement this, define a subarray via a left index <code>l</code> and a right index <code>r</code>. The left index is inclusive and the right index is exclusive.<br><br>
            If we have the array <code>[1,2,3,4,5]</code> an <code>l=2</code> and <code>r=4</code> would define the subarray <code>[3,4]</code>.<br><br>
            Now iterate over all possible <code>l</code> and <code>r</code> and find sums and take maximums:
            <pre><code>
                let A be the array
                Let n be the length of the array
                mx = 0
                for l in 0 to n:
                    for r in l+1 to n+1:
                        sm = 0
                        for i in l to r:
                            sm += A[i]
                        mx = max(mx, sm)
                mx is the answer
            </code></pre>
            </p>

            <p>
            What is important for competitive programming is to figure out te time compexity.
            Notice the line which the algorithm will run the most (and thus spend the majority of its time running is)
            <code>sm += A[i]</code>.<br>
            We can guess this from it being inside the three for loops.<br><br>
            <code>sm += A[i]</code> runs once every time we add an element from a subarray to <code>sm</code>.
            As we iterate over every subarray, the line runs once for every element in every possible subarray.<br><br>
            To calculate how many times we find how many total elements there are in every posible subarray. Lets do casework on the length of a subarray:<br><br>

            A subarray of length <script type="math/tex">1</script> has <script type="math/tex">1</script> element
            and there are <script type="math/tex">n</script> possible subarrays of length <script type="math/tex">1</script>. <br>
            ex: <code>A=[1,2,3]</code> has the length <script type="math/tex">1</script> subarrays <code>[1], [2], [3]</code>.<br>
            Similarly for length <script type="math/tex">2</script> subarrays, there are <script type="math/tex">n-1</script> of them.<br><br>

            In general, if the length of a subarray is <script type="math/tex">m</script> then there are <script type="math/tex">n-m+1</script> of those subarrays.<br>
            To find the amount of elements in all of these subarrays, we sum for all <script type="math/tex">m</script> from <script type="math/tex">1</script> to <script type="math/tex">n</script>, <script type="math/tex">(m)(n-m+1)=mn-m^2+m</script>.<br><br>

            Breaking this up we want to compute: <br><script type="math/tex">(1n+2n+3n+\dots+nn) - (1^2+2^2+3^2+\dots+n^2) + (1 + 2 + 3 +\dots + n) = n(1+2+3+\dots+n) - (1^2+2^2+3^2+\dots+n^2) + (1 + 2 + 3 +\dots+ n)</script>.<br><br>

            Using the knowledge <script type="math/tex">1+2+3+\dots+n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\ \text{ and }1^2+2^2+3^2+\dots+n^2=\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}</script><br>
            the above simplifies to <script type="math/tex">\frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} - \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^3}{6} + \frac{n^2}{2} + \frac{n}{3}
                =\mathcal{O}(n^3)</script>.<br><br>

            This means the simple solution is a cubic algorithm which is pretty slow.</p>

            <h4>Linear Solution</h4>
            <p>
            The linear solution iterates through the array keeping track of a current sum and a maximum overall sum.
            The one by one elements of the array are added to the current sum.<br><br>
            If the current sum ever goes negative we might as well start a new subarray with current sum <script type="math/tex">0</script> so we do so.<br><br>

            Consider what happens when we add a new element, <code>a</code> to our current sum <code>sm</code>.
            If <code>a</code> is positive then adding it to <code>sm</code> would increase <code>sm</code> so this is what we should do.<br><br>
            Even if <code>a</code> is negative, if <code>sm + a</code> is non-negative we should still add it to <code>sm</code>. <br><br>
            Not adding it would force us to then have <code>sm = 0</code> as we have to have our subarrays are contiguous.
            Having <code>sm = 0</code> can't be better then the non-negative <code>sm + a</code> even if <code>a</code> is negative so we should add <code>a</code> to <code>sm</code>.

            This creates the code:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
            let A be the array
            let n be the length of A
            sm = 0
            mx = 0
            for i in 0 to n:
                if sm + A[i] &gt;= 0:
                    sm += A[i]
                else if sm + A[i] &lt; 0:
                    sm = 0
                mx = max(mx, sm)
            mx is the answer
            </code></pre>
            <p>
            This solution is linear or <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{O}(n)</script>, as it runs the inside of the for loop, an <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{O}(1)</script> operation, <script type="math/tex">n</script> times.
