				<legend>PClassic Spring 2023 Signups</legend>
				<div>
				<p>
				<b>PClassic Signups</b><br><br>The PClassic competition will take place in-person on April 22, 2023 (Saturday), at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA.<br><br>
				This will be a one-day trip from Stuyvesant on a chartered bus. Departure and return times are not yet certain however expect a morning departure around 8am-9am from Stuyvesant, and returning back to the city around 7pm-10pm.<br><br>
				Based on current budget estimates, there will <b>be no cost or payment required to go on the trip</b>, with funds coming from a SU allocation to StuyCCC. Lunch should be covered by the orgnizers. Breakfast and dinner will not be provided so you should bring your own.<br><br>
				Due to limitations with the size of the bus and chaperone requirements, <b>we can only accommodate a maximum of 45-50 students.</b><br><br>
				<b>Signups are NOT first-come-first-served.</b> In case too many students sign up, we will consider factors such as ability, CCC meeting attendance (if you are a member), and team size (discouraging 1 person teams) to see who gets to go.<br><br>
				Teams can have anywhere from 1-4 members, however teams of 1 person are strongly discouraged and receive lower priority in case too many students sign up, so you can enter your team on the form if you have already decided on one. If you wish to be assigned a team depending on availability, there is an option for that on the form.<br><br>
				There will be two divisions: Classic (formerly Novice) and Advanced (formerly Standard). If your team is composed of people new to CS, we'd recommend choosing the novice division. If you have experience coding and think you can solve a couple problems 5-8, we'd recommend participating in the standard division.<br><br>
				<b>The only three languages you are allowed to compete in are Python, Java, and C++.</b><br><br>
				The PClassic website is <a href="https://pclassic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. You can find the rules, more infomration about logistics, as well as past problem sets, at their website.<br><br>
				<b>Only one person from each team needs to fill the signup form out.</b>In case of any changes to the form, or special circumstances (eg. you having your own transportation) please <a href="mailto:ypan31@stuy.edu,ntarsis30@stuy.edu,cwong31@stuy.edu" target="_blank"> email us.</a><br><br>
				The signup form with more detailed info is available <a href="https://forms.gle/o38YRfcEX6YLvMmA6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, <b>signups are tentatively due April 8, 2023</b>. More information will come later on, either fill out the signup form or get the @Ping role on <a href="https://discord.gg/zrkVxKV77J" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Discord</a> to be notified of updates, further logistics information, and paperwork. <b>READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FULLY ON THE FORM BEFORE FILLING IT OUT, THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES WITH THE FORM'S INSTRUCTIONS AND THIS ONE HERE.</b><br><br>
				In addition, <b>PLEASE HELP US ADVERTISE</b>. Tell <b>anyone</b> who may be interested (such as your CS classes for example), there is <b>no requirement</b> that one is in StuyCCC to participate.<br><br>
				Lastly: due to NYCDOE chaperone requirements, we are looking for <b>parent chaperones</b> who can come with us on the trip. Please contact us (via email of Discord) ASAP.

                <p>Cornell is holding a programming contest on <b>Saturday, May 7th, 2022</b> at their Cornell Tech Campus on <b>Roosevelt Island in NYC</b>. You can form your own teams and attend the event separately from CCC, but depending on how many of you all want to go, it might be good for us to have a teacher/chaperone go as well. To this end, we are trying to gauge interest, so if you are interested, please indicate it <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-qgNK87gRlWUSCZlhZ2oiUMRJEKJt_1oKtSZjAefYwOBVvQ/viewform" target="_blank">here</a>.

                <h4>COVID And Upcoming Meets</h4>
                <p>Hey everyone!</p>
                <p>The current covid guidelines have made it so the vast majority of after school activities will be canceled until further notice, and unfortunately CCC falls in that group, so we will not be holding any in person meetings this week and probably the upcoming weeks as well.</p>
                <p>However, we might be holding virtual meetings starting from next week if there is enough interest, please complete this <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.gle/wBCRrZ6d4RicHVaE9">form</a> to specify whether you want virtual meetings or not. Please fill this form out ASAP, so we can have an accurate measure on what to do for upcoming meets. </p>
                <p>Reminder that if we do hold virtual meets, they will most likely be held on our <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/brwQ5bw9">discord server</a>. Other than information and meetings being posted on there, there are also fun activities like POTDs to try out, so I highly suggest you join our discord server if you haven't already. Stay safe!</p>

We also have a list of our members on <a target="_blank" href="https://stuyactivities.org/stuyccc">StuyActivities</a>, if you want to find people to ask.</p>

                <p>PClassic (one of our main competitions that we try to attend) will be happening on Saturday Nov 20th at the Stuyvesant building. It is a team competition with up to 4 members per team, so find some buddies who want to program with you. It is a bit on the difficult side, but we encourage everyone to try. If you want to get a taste of their difficulty, you can look at past contests on their <a target="_blank" href="https://pclassic.org/">website</a>. We will be sending a sign up form and more information soon, so be on the lookout for that.</p>
