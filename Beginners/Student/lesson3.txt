Lesson 3: What even are loops?

K, everyone count to 10
K, everyone count backwards from 10 to 0
!!h3!!Any questions?
!!breaks!!45
Hopefully there is enough space so that y'all don't immediately see this
Anyway, we are going to introduce loops
They are exactly what they sound like. They loop from one value to another until they finish or crash

!!h3!!The while loop

Ignore the stuff below 'till I demo on the board

ctr = 10
while (ctr > 0):
	print(ctr)
	ctr--

!!h3!!The for loop

Again ignore the stuff below 'till I demo on the board

for i in range(10):
	print(i)

!!h3!!When to use each one

Anyone have any ideas?

		<td>Know how many times the loop will iterate, but not the endpoint</td>

!!h3!!I shall now take questions and comments and whatever

If we have time remaining, we could start with lesson 4
